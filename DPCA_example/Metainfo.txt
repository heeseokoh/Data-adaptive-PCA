Example: ‘Examples of using DPCA with daily maximum precipitation data in August during the period of year 1997 to 2008. The data are available with loading max_prec.RData file. First from grid_finder function we find the indices of East Asia region, perform and plot loading matrices of first 4 PCs. We may produce some results, which is dpca_loading2.pdf. Finally, we plot 4 PCs as a time series, which is dpca_pcs.pdf.’
